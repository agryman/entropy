Problem: How to Create Illustrations for Mathematical Documents
2017-03-12

I am writing some math notes.
I’ve decided to do these in R Studio so that I can do some numerical experiments
to illustrate the concepts and visualize the resulting objects.
I can easily generate nice plots using R.

I also want to include line drawings to illustrate the geometry involved.
For example, show the mapping of a sphere to the plane.

I’ve been using R markdown which is nice because the output can be HTML.
I could also use knitr with LaTeX. 
Note that the thing I am really using is knitr which is an R package.
knitr supports several formats that let you combine R code with documentation,
and pull in the results of running the R code into the documentation.
The easiest format is called R markdown and its source files use the extension “.Rmd”.
R markdown can be rendered as LaTeX, HTML, etc.

In R markdown R code chunks and inline code as entered using:
```{r}
…
```
and `r …`

The nice thing about R markdown is that you can apparently do any kind of LaTeX math formatting even
if the output format is HTML.
I believe that MathJAX is a very complete implementation of LaTeX that lets you render math nicely 
in a Web browser using Javascript.
This means that with R markdown you can generate both HTML and LaTeX that look identical.

If the documentation is a complex LaTeX document, e.g. maybe including Z Notation, then
there may not be any advantage to viewing it as HTML in a web browser.
So there is no point in this case to converting it to R markdown.
Instead, change its file extension to be “.Rnw” (no web).
Now you can imbed R code chunks and inline R code using a different syntax.
<<>>=
…
@
and
\Sexpr{…}

ShareLaTeX supports knitr too.
It uses the file extension “*.Rtex” which is more consistent than using “*.Rnw”.


Finally, you can write HTML.
The file extension is “*.Rhtml”.

So what is the best way to include a figure in the document?
It would be great if the figure was dynamic like the plots in the sense that
I could define variables in R and then use their values in the figure, e.g. to
compute the position of a point.

I have found out that the tikZ package can do a lot of dynamic math calculations.
This reduces the problem to how do I pass computed values from the R session into the tikZ session?
It should be possible to pass values to TeX variables and then use them in tikZ.
I need to verify this.


Here are some ways to create diagrams:
1. Draw it on paper, scan the paper to PDF or PNG, crop the desired region, and include it as an image. 
2. Draw it freehand on my iPad Pro using my Apple Pencil, crop the result, and include it as an image.
3. Use a vector graphic drawing program such as Adobe Illustrator and insert the PDF or PNG as an image.
4. Use the R graphics packages such as ggplot2 and annotation them. This is promising but is it a force fit? Can I create whatever I want? The advantage is that it’s nicely integrated with R and can use R variables.
5. Use tikz in a LaTeX. How do I pull in R variables?
6. Use the tikz engine in an R chunk. This works in HTML output. How do I pull in R variables?

I found some YouTube tutorials about tikz and ShareLatex. 
One of them talked about how to create math diagrams in GeoGebra and export them as tikz.
I will try that.

GeoGebra seems to be good for creating educational material.
It does not seem easy to use for creating diagrams that have precisely controlled
features such a mathematical notation in labels.

ShareLatex also integrates knitr and tikz.
Read the online documentation in ShareLatex.

GeoGebra may not be a good choice if it can’t use math formulas in labels.
Try tikz and just do static diagrams - these are the illustrations, not driven by data.

tikZ certainly seems very powerful.
I am sure you could create any kind of diagram using it.
It takes a lot of ideas from PostScript.
There is a 700+ page user manual.
The syntax is very non-uniform and idiosyncratic.
However, once you learn it you would probably be very powerful.
I’ll invest more time reading.
Still I would like to see how to pass in R values into tikz.
One klugy way would be to write TeX definitions into a file, e.g. values.tex, using R and then
read that file into the tikZ code using \input{values.tex}.

The following might be possible:

```{r}
A <- 3
```

$$
\def\A{\Sexpr{A}}
